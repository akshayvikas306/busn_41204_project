# BUSN 41204 Machine Learning - Final Project
# Authors - Abdul Lateef, Akshay Vikas, Sameer Warraich

## Project Organization

1. Data - Contains original 7 CSVs (players_15 to players_21), 1 RData file for cleaned data, some RDS files for storing intermediate variables.
2. Data Prep.R - Data Cleaning & Merging Code
3. Data Exploration.R - Summaries & Plots
4. Data Training.R - Generates models for predicting player value (all positions)
5. Data Training_A.R - Generates models for predicting player value (Attackers)
6. Data Training_M.R - Generates models for predicting player value (Midfielders)
7. Data Training_D.R - Generates models for predicting player value (Defenders)
8. Data Training_G.R - Generates models for predicting player value (Goalkeepers)
9. Data Training_Overall.R - Generates models for predicting player overall (Boosting & Neural Networks Models)
